This is all the homework, coding and otherwise, that I completed while attending DePaul University for a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from March 2010 until March 2012.  


My current GPA as of December 2011 is 3.970


From DePaul's website:


    The program exposes students to the complete life-cycle of computer application development including abstraction, modeling and algorithm development, leveraging computer systems, programming languages and development frameworks, and software development techniques and processes. Students also have the opportunity to study and develop applications in diverse applied areas such as:
    * Computer Security
    * Robotics and Computer Vision
    * Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
    * Databases
    * Mobile and Embedded Systems
    * Intelligent Systems
    * Computer Games
    * Distributed Systems and Web Development
    * Computer Graphics
    * Computer Games
    
    Graduates of the Computer Science Master's program are typically employed as developers and software engineers, and many also pursue a Ph.D. degree. The program is structured to provide students an expertise in the following core areas:
    * Programming and Software Development
    * Algorithm Design and Computer Science Concepts
    * Computer and Database Systems

    Students will acquire a broad range of skills including:
    * Knowledge of key computer science concepts, techniques and algorithms
    * An understanding of the workings and the API (Application Programming Interface) of modern computer systems including database systems
    * Skills in programming and software development
    * Expertise in your chosen area of Computer Science
    * Research skills and experiences that can be applied in any endeavor
