Applied Algorithms and Structures
---------------------------------


	This course covers a number of fundamental algorithms including sorting and graph 
	algorithms as well as some general techniques for designing algorithms, such as 
	recursion, divide and conquer, greedy method, and dynamic programming. We will 
	also be analyzing the complexity of our algorithms to determine how they perform 
	and scale. We will also be implementing the algorithms in Java, so you will need 
	to pick up Java.
