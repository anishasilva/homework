<h2>Raymond Elward's DIA discussion</h2>

<p>Starting DIA 2/24/2011. I wrote up the host server program earlier this
week. I began with my host server application and hard coding in the name
server functions.</p>

<p>This proved a to take a lot more thought than previous assignments. First I
needed a way to implement the name server. I thought about keeping it as a
static function to serve up anything that the agents or host server requested.
but I then realized I should just start it off on its own thread and server
back requests to its clients(agents and hostserver). The question is now
implementing a way for it to listen for these clients. I'm also a little
worried about how i'm going to implement the name server webpage.</p>

<p>I have the name server web page now all set up with some dummy values. I
crate some classes to store host information and agent information. now i'm a
little worried about implementing a way to store these values so that the
nameserver's gathering from its service port can properly have the information
ready for the name server's user portal.</p>

<p>Got the dynamic webpage working for my name server. looks pretty nice too.
Haven't hooked any of the host server of agents up to it yet, so I instantiated
my Lists of agents and hosts with some dummy data and it is looking pretty
good.</p>

<p>I now added code to the host server so that when it starts up before it goes
into its loop of accepting access to spawn agents it registers itself with the
name server. name server must be ran before the host servers. They will all
register with the name server and print out their info on the name server's
page.</p>

<p>When a new host server registers with the name server the protocol it sends
is: HOST:&amp;ip&amp;port</p>

<p>When the host server notifies the name server of a new Agent the protocol
is: NEWAGENT:&amp;ID&amp;IP&amp;port&amp;agentComPort</p>

<p>When the name server replies to a new agent is replies
NEWAGENT:&amp;name&amp;groupId&amp;GROUPMEM:&amp;ip&amp;port&amp;GROUPMEM:&amp;ip&amp;port
//ect</p>

<p>When an agent wants to submit something to the database to be stored for its
group the protocol is: STORE&amp;GROUPID&amp;DATA</p>

<p>When an agent wants to contact the database for all its group's data the
protocol is: GET&amp;GROUPID</p>

<p>There is a known bug that the name server displays the wrong number of
agents. It doesnt decrement the number correctly when and agent leaves that
server for a new one.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h4>Lunch problem:</h4>

<p>I solved the lunch problem as it presented itself in the DIA by making it so
that agents could only send a full packet of data to get or store things for
their group on the database. Also all the collections that held data I wrapped
them with Collections.synchronized() and instantiated them as volatile so that
the JVM could do a lot of the thread management. This method of locking out
other processes would create a lunch problem if the agents needed to a lot of
back and forth with the database, but as I implemented it the single packet
being sent creates no back and forth that would hold the server’s database
hostage if someone submitting data decided to go to lunch in the middle of
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also in my simple
example I allowed the repetition of data.</p>

<h4>Sharing data:</h4>

<p>I'm sharing data between groups with the DIAdb.java file. This file will run
as a server. Agents are the clients. They connect and give their group number.
Each group will have their own data structure filled with all the relevant
data. This will allow the data to be stored at a central location reachable by
each member of the group for display.</p>

<h4>Migrating agents:</h4>

<p>I migrated the agents basically the same way as in the host server
application. The one difference as that the client can't tell these to move
they just move randomly 20% of the time someone interacts with them. In a real
life application they would only leave if there was a reason to, like if the
system sent it a message that it was shutting down soon.</p>

<p>I implemented the agents with a dead link migration approach.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I believe this method to truly be
better for this situation than the re-direct migration or zombie migration
methods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In my program the central
hub of all interaction is the name server.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This is where the users will find all the current location
to the agents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>following the
agents around or referring to them by their locations is a bad idea, because
they will be migrating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>NOTE: make sure that your browser isn't cacheing the files. It might not
work correctly.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The two main things that are note in
line with the assignment because I didn’t have enough time to fully implement
them and how I would have implemented them:<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>1. The first thing is the migration of the agents. I did not make them sleep
and move on their own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They still move
randomly but only when interacted with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If I had time to implement it with a random timer I would have spawned
another thread for the agent that would constantly be sleeping in a while loop
and then in a random occurrence upon waking up it would send a signal for the
agent to migrate to a new hostserver.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is done in my program by asking the name server for a new
hostserver and then the agent moves there.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>2. The second thing is the way data is stored for the agents in the
database.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The assignment has a
question and answer that the agents store for their group.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In my implementation The agent just
gather strings of data from the user through an input box at the agents
location.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I had time to
implement the QA data collection I would have made a class in my data base that
stored questions and answers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There would be a file on disk with all the questions and answers that
the DIAdb.java would read and make a hashtable of upon being started.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then when an agent wanted to get a QA
to display it would query the DIAdb for one, then when it got an answer from
the users of the agent it would store the users input answer in the data base
and associate it with the standard QA that were there.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
