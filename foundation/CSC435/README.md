Class structure
---------------

Class will be challenging. Students are expected to do much of the reading on their own. Some topics will be covered in the lectures, but because time is short a number of topics will be covered only in the reading, and will appear on tests.
We will have both programming assignments, and non-programming assignments.

Java programming background is required. However if you program well in other similar languages you can probably pick up enough java to pass the class. This is primarily a lecture/dicsussion class, but the programming assignments are used to guarantee deep understanding of the material.

Programming assignments are substantial. Programming tips may be discussed, but programming will not be taught.
