Program Language Concepts
-------------------------
This class was mainly focused on the midterm and final exam.  These short assignments are done in scala to demonstrate programming language concepts that are prevalent throughout many programming languages.


	Programming paradigms and language concepts: functional programming; comparison of
	object-oriented languages; type systems for functional and object-oriented 
	languages; runtime systems for functional and object-oriented languages. A 
	variety of programming languages will be used to illustrate concepts, 
	e.g., JavaScript, Ruby, Scala, Scheme.
