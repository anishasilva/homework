(4/4)</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"><b>Due 5:45pm, Monday 4/11.&nbsp; 
(Note: As we will be discussing nested queries again next week, this assignment 
can be turned in up to three days late -- that is, until 5:45pm on Thursday 4/14 
-- with no penalty.&nbsp; However, no assignments will be accepted beyond 5:45pm on 
Thursday 4/14.)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"><b>Reading:</b>  Sections 
4.3, 5.1, and 5.3 of Elmasri &amp; Navathe (and also pp.70-75 for the example 
database).&nbsp; Chapters 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10 of Price's SQL book may also be 
helpful, though they contain much more material than we have covered.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">Your task in this assignment 
is to write a set of SQL queries on a set of tables I supply.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"><b>1.&nbsp; </b>First, 
download the script file company.sql from the course web site and run it in 
SQLDeveloper to construct the example database illustrated in Chapter 3 of Elmasri &amp; Navathe (pp.70-75).&nbsp; Inspect the schemas and tables in SQLDeveloper to make sure you understand the structure of the database.&nbsp; 
(Note that some changes have been made to the database state -- it differs 
somewhat from the state that is illustrated in Figure 3.6 on p.72.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"><b>2.&nbsp; </b>In a separate 
.sql file (do not modify company.sql), write a script that contains the 
following fourteen SQL queries (in this order):</p>
<blockquote>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">1. Retrieve the names of 
	all employees in department 5 who work more than 15 hours per week on the ProductX 
project.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">2. List the names of all 
	employees who have a son with the same first name as themselves.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">3. Find the names of all 
employees are are directly supervised by 'Franklin T Wong'.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">4. For each project, list the 
project name, project number, and the total hours per week (by all employees) spent on that 
project.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">5. Retrieve the names of all 
employees who work on every project. (In other words, look at the list of 
	projects given in the PROJECT table, and retrieve the names of all employees 
	who work on every one of them.)&nbsp; (Note that it is not sufficient for an 
	employee the work on just some of the projects -- he/she must work on <u>all</u> 
	of the projects to be included in the result.)</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">6. Retrieve the names of all 
employees who do not work on any project.&nbsp; (In other words, look at the 
	list of projects given in the PROJECT table, and retrieve the names of all 
	employees who work on none of them.)</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">7. For each department, 
retrieve the department name and the average salary of all employees working in 
that department.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">8. Retrieve the average 
salary of all female employees.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">9. Find the names and 
addresses of all employees who work on at least one project located in Houston 
	(that is, who work on at least one project having a Plocation of Houston) 
	but whose department has no location in Houston (that is, whose department 
	does not have a Dlocation of Houston).&nbsp; (Note that the second condition 
	is <u>not</u> equivalent to the department having a location that is not in 
	Houston -- the department must not have a location Houston to be included in 
	the result.)</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">10. List the last names of 
all department managers who have no dependents.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">11. For each department whose 
average salary is greater than $40,000, retrieve the department name and the number 
of employees in that department.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">12. Retrieve the names of all 
employees who work in the department that has the employee with the lowest 
salary among all employees.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">13. Retrieve the names of all 
employees whose supervisor's supervisor has '888665555' for his/her Ssn.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">14. Retrieve the names of 
	employees whose salary is within $20,000 of the salary of the employee who 
	is paid the most in the company (e.g., if the highest salary in the company 
	is $80,000, retrieve the names of all employees that make at least $60,000).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">(Some of these are similar to 
the queries in Exercise 6.16 on pp. 187-188, Exercise 5.5 on p. 141, and 
Exercise 5.7 on pp. 141-142.)</p>
-->
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">Add a comment before 
each query in your script file to label the queries 1 through 14&nbsp; (e.g., 
the comment '-- 1.' on a line before the first query, the comment '-- 2.' on a line before the second query, 
et cetera).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">Run the 
script file containing your queries to verify that your results are correct.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"><b>3.&nbsp;
</b>Include a comment at the top of your script file giving your name, the 
course number and section, the assignment number, and the date of submission, 
e.g.:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">/*<br>
<i>YourName</i><br>

*/</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"><b>4.&nbsp; </b>
Submit the .sql file containing your queries under &quot;Assignment 2&quot;.&nbsp; You do 
not have to submit the output generated by the script.&nbsp; Do not submit company.sql 
or include code from it in your submission -- your submitted file should contain 
only your queries and the requested comments.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"><b>Remarks:</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">1.&nbsp; As is always the 
case, it is your responsibility to make sure that any files you upload are readable and in 
the correct locations.&nbsp; I recommend that you download them for yourself 
after submitting them to be sure that they have been uploaded correctly.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">2.&nbsp; Remember that this 
assignment, like all others, must be completed individually -- no collaboration 
among students is allowed.</p>
