CSC 202 - Discrete Structures for Computer Science
==================================================

	This course introduces basic mathematical tools essential for solving problems in 
	computer science. The mathematical topics are presented through their applications 
	in computer science: logic and set theory in the context of relational databases, 
	arithmetic, number theory, and algebra through cryptography; graph theory and 
	discrete structures through puzzles and games. Optional subjects include fractals 
	(recursion and rewriting systems), computer graphics (linear algebra), and 
	Artificial Intelligence (first-order logic).


This course was mostly written work so the computer versions of the course work I was able to find mostly leaves out what I had handed in and is a little incomplete.
