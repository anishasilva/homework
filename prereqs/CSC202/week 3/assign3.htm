<p><span lang="en-us">Review the sections about sets and set operations, 
focusing on the Cartesian product and the power set, 
and then read the sections about relations and properties of relations in your reference book.&nbsp; In <b>Discrete Mathematics and

Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning</span>, 200<span lang="en-us">4 those sections are 
section 5.1 on pages 255 - 269 and sections 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, and 10.5 on pages 
571 - 611 and 632 - 649.&nbsp; Note that the text covers more than we did in 
class.&nbsp; You should focus on the concepts we covered in class when reading.</span></p>
