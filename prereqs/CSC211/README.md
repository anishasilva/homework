CSC 211 - Programming in Java 1
===============================

This Class was an intro to java class.  I had taken c++ in high school and knew a little bit of java before going into this, but this class gave a baseline for important object-oriented principles.


	This course focuses on developing complex programs using an object-oriented 
	language. Students write programs that utilize classes and objects, data members, 
	and methods for code modularization and arrays for solving problems. Classes, 
	simple and complex data types, conditionals, repetition, and other principles of 
	object-oriented programming will be introduced.
