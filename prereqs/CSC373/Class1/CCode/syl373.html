<h2>CSC 373: Computer Systems 1</h2><br/>
</center>

<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<p>
This course covers the concepts underlying all computer systems and how they affect the 
correctness, performance, and utility of application programming. The course topics include 
information representations, assembly language and debuggers, memory hierarchy, virtual memory, 
basic system-level I/O, networking, and network programming.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
The firm prequisite is programming experience. For CTI students, the second course
in the basic Java sequence (CSC 212) or the Java for Programmers course (CSC 224) would
be sufficient. In general, a student should have completed at least two basic programming
courses in a modern language such as Java. The course relies heavily on coding examples 
written in C and several assignments involve the compilation and execution of C programs.
(Students will not be required to write any C programs from scratch but may need to modify
existing programs.) Although no knowledge of C in particular is assumed, the ability to program 
is assumed.

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
Because Summer courses are only five weeks long, there will not be a midterm exam. Instead, 
there will be short weekly review quizzes and discussion of these in the following weak. 
The final exam is a quality control exam with material drawn from and, therefore, closely 
related to the questions on the quizzes and material from the homework exercises. There will
be one homework assignment per week, with a week to complete the assignment. All homework 
must be submitted on time so that the material then can be discussed in class. Answers will
be posted.<br/>
The grading will be determined as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Homework:</b> 75%
<li><b>Final Exam:</b> 25%
</ul>
A student must pass the final exam to pass the course.
