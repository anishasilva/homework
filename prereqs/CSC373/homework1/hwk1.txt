                                          Homework 1

Points: 100
Due:    June 24th, before midnight

You submit either via email to me (kalin@cs.depaul.edu) or by using the COL Web site.
I strongly recommend that you submit plain text, as this minimizes errors with file
uploads and the like.

The easiest way is to furnish your answers as documentation in the code. Basically,
you should focus on two questions:

   1. What does the code do?
   2. How does the code do what it does?

There are three C programs, each to be compiled and executed.

Good luck.
