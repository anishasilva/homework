  <h4>Purpose:</h4>
  To go over material from the first half of the quarter including:
  <ul>
    <li>Compiler optimization
    <li>Linking and ELF format
    <li>Creating, waiting and signaling processes
  </ul>

  <ol type="1">
  <li><h4>Compiler optimization (20 Points)</h4>
    <p>
      Consider the following program below.
      Re-write <code>int superSum ()</code> in C, but optimized.

      <li>Write a file <code>optimizeAndInvestigate2.c</code> that has <code>limit</code> and <code>int sum (int sumLimit)</code>.
	The function <code>int sum (int sumLimit)</code> should just return the sum of the integers from 1 up to including <code>sumLimit</code> ([1 . . sumLimit]).

	Next, create the whole program <code>optimizeAndInvestigate</code> by linking the object files from both C files.

  <li><h4>Processes and such (40 Points)</h4>

    <p>Write two programs: <code>mama.c</code> and <code>brat.c</code>.</p>
    <p>
      <code>mama.c</code> will make 4 baby processes.
      Unfortunately all 4 are brats -- they will misbehave by randomly jumping on the bed.
      Mama is long-suffering, but when she has had enough (that is, when the user presses &quot;enter&quot;) she will send the signal <code>SIGTERM</code> to them to tell them to go to sleep.
      She will verify that all have finished by <code>wait()</code>ing for them and printing out the brat's process id and the number of times that it has jumped on the bed (which the brat returned with <code>exit(<i>numJumps</i>)</code>.
      She will briefly <code>sleep()</code> to make sure she's heard from all the brats.
      Then she will quit.

            exit(-1);
        (3) If this process is the baby then does:

    <p><code>brat.c</code> will get its number and start jumping on the bed at random intervals.
      Before it jumps on the bed it will set up a listener for its mama.
      After mama yells at it (send it <code>SIGTERM</code>) it will output that it is going to bed.
      It will then <code>exit()</code> with the number of times it has jumped on the bed.
