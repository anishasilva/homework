Homework Assignment 1</B></h2>

In this assignment, you will write a program to keep
track of items in a shopping cart.
Please call your main class <B>HW1</B>, and
<B>do not use packages</B>.
<P>First, you should write an Item class; an Item has a name (String),
a unique ID (String), a price (double), and a quantity (int).
Plus, the class will need a constructor,
a toString method, and possibly getters and setters.
<P>Your program should allow a user to do the following:
<P><OL><LI>Add an item to the cart.  The user should type
the item's name, ID, and price.  Your program should create
an Item object (with quantity set to 1), and add it to the cart.
If the user tyes an ID which corresponds to an
Item object which already exists in the cart, the
existing Item's quantity should be incremented by 1, rather
than creating a new Item object.
<P><LI>Delete an item.  The user should type the item's ID,
and the Item object should be removed from the cart.
If no such item exists, then
an error message should be displayed.
<P><LI>Retrieve an item.  The user should type the item's ID,
and the system should display the name, ID, price, and quantity of the
corresponding Item object.  If no such item exists, then an error
message should be
displayed.
<P><LI>Print out all items in the cart.  The items should be printed in
alphabetical order by name.
<!--Finally, if 2 items have the same last and first
names, then the ID's (which are unique) will determine the
ordering in the printout.-->
</OL>

<P>Your program should utilize a class called <b>ShoppingCart</b> (which you will write),
which stores the
group of items that your program maintains.  </b>ShoppingCart</b>
must implement an interface called <code>Group</code>, which
is specified as follows:

<xmp>
// the Group interface has a template variable to specify what type of
// data is stored in the Group.
public interface Group<E> {
  public void addItem(E item);
  public void removeItem(E item);
  public void retrieveItem(E item);
  public String toString( ); // used in printing out the items in the group
}
</xmp>

In order to be able to efficiently execute each of the 4 possible actions
that your program must support, your ShoppingCart class should use
two different kinds of Collections:
a HashMap<String, Item>, and a TreeSet<Item>.  The HashMap is used to
efficiently retrieve an Item by its ID, and the TreeSet is used to efficiently print
out all Items in alphabetical order by name.  Each item is stored
in both data structures (the Map and the Set).
<P>
Here, then, is the start of the ShoppingCart and HW1 classes:

<XMP>
// in ShoppingCart.java
import java.util.*;

public class ShoppingCart implements Group<Item> {
  // the items, stored in a Map.  In this Collection, the items are
  // keyed by their ID's (which are Strings)
  private HashMap<String, Item> keyedItems = new HashMap<String, Item>( );
  private TreeSet<Item> sortedItems = new TreeSet<Item>( );

  // you might need a default constructor

  // you'll also need at least the methods that are required by the Group<E> interface
}

// in HW1.java
public class HW1 {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart( );

    // then code to interact with the user, in which the user first enters which
    // action is to be performed, then additional information an item name,
    // ID, and price

  }
}
</XMP>

Please see <A HREF="http://condor.depaul.edu/~slytinen/383f10/hw1/hw1help.txt">this file</a>
for guidance as to how to write each of these classes.</font>
<p>
The <code>main</code> method in the </code>HW1</code> class, which
will determine the user interface, is up to you.
One approach would be to have the user type
a number (1-5) to indicate what operation they wish to perform (5 = exit the program).
Then your main method would have a loop which repeatedly prompts the user to
type 1-5 and executes the appropriate action.
<P>
Keep in mind that TreeSets require that their data
implement the Comparable&lt;E&gt; interface (in this case, Comparable&lt;Item&gt;),
which requires the class to have a compareTo method.  (HashMaps also require their Keys
to implement certain methods, but since the Keys in your HashMap will be item ID's, which
are instances of the built-in
String Java class, you will not have to worry about this.)
