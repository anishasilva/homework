Homework Assignment 4</B></h2>
Due:  Wednesday, October 27

<BR><BR><BR>
<ul><P><LI>(60 points):  You task is to add 2 methods
to the <A HREF="http://condor.depaul.edu/~slytinen/383f10/hw4/TreeSet383.java">
TreeSet383&lt;E extends Comparable&lt;E&gt;&gt; class</A>,
presented during lecture on October 13.
In particular, you will add two methods to this class:
<p>
<UL><LI><CODE>boolean remove(E obj)</CODE>:  Remove a piece of data from the
binary search tree.  Return true if the data was removed, or false if it was
not in the tree to begin with.  You should follow the algorithm presented
in class for removing items from binary search trees.
<p><LI><CODE>Iterator&lt;E&gt; iterator( )</CODE>:
Return an Iterator that can iterate
through the data in the tree.  The iteration should be an
"in-order" iteration (i.e., ascending order).  Recall that iterators
have the following methods:
<p><UL><LI><CODE>boolean hasNext( )</CODE>
<LI><CODE>T next( )</CODE>
<LI><CODE>void remove( )</CODE>
</UL>
</ul>
<P><LI>
(40 points) Show the result of inserting the following numbers into an empty AVL tree: 5,50,10,40,15,30,20,25,55,60. To increase your chances of partial credit in case your answer is incorrect, show intermediate results, such as the state of the tree immediately before and after each rotation that is performed as the numbers are inserted.

<B>Note:</B> Since it is painful to draw trees on a computer,
you may feel free to scan hand-written answers for problem 2
(and turn in the scanned document via Course Online), or turn in
hard copy in class, or fax your answers to Problem 2 to 312-362-6116.
If you send a fax, be sure to make it clear on the cover page of the
fax that Prof. Lytinen is the recipient. Also, I have found our fax
service to be unreliable, so please e-mail me informing me that you
have sent a fax. If you do not receive a confirmation e-mail from me,
please fax it again.
