<LI>(50 points)  Show the result of inserting the following numbers into an 
empty red-black tree:  70,50,30,60,65,80,75,55,72,71,62,57.  To increase your 
chances of partial credit in case your answer is incorrect, show intermediate results,
such as the state of the tree immediately before and after each rotation that
is performed as the numbers are inserted.
<P><LI>(50 points)  Show the results of inserting the
numbers 18, 39, 52, 1, 23, 5, and 69 into an empty 
hash table of size 17, using the following techniques:<p>
<ol type=a><li>Linear probing
<li>Quadratic probing
<li>Double hashing
</ol>
<p>For all techniques, the hash function h(x) = x%17.
For double hashing, the second hash function h<sub>2</sub>(x)
= 13 - x%13.
